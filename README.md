# Project Underscore by Moeru AI

`.ai` domains are costly, so we freely offer the `foo._.moeru.ai` domain for open-source projects.

## FAQ

### Why not `foo.moeru.ai`?

Moeru AI's projects mainly use the `foo.moeru.ai`, so this is to avoid (possible future) naming conflicts.

So we used one of the shortest possible (and interesting, `._.`) suffixes.

`foo.moeru.ai` if the project is moved under the Moeru AI organization.

If you move your project to Moeru AI (and we accept it), you will get the admin role for this project and the `foo.moeru.ai` domain.

### SLA

We do not guarantee SLA but rather do our best to deliver.

If there are no surprises, we can provide stable service until `2027-01-26`.

We may extend this period once Moeru AI becomes valuable.
